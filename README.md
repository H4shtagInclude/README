#### Hello friend! 
My name is **Anthony Jackson** a **15 years old African-American** game developer born on July 13 of 2007.  

My favorite hobbies besides making game is sports like football and basketball and riding my bike or going for a jog. I usually hang out with other people online making it very easy to contact me about thing you want.  

You can email me at **hashtaginclude_talk@outlook.com** for ~~professional~~ or non-professional stuff.  
I’m currently a student in my sophomore year of high school (grade 10) and can’t wait to finally have the freedom of being out in the real world.  

You can find me on different social platforms like Reddit or Twitter. Here is a list of my socials. Twitter is @H4shtagInclude, Reddit is HashtagInclude-Rddit, Github is H4shtag Include.
